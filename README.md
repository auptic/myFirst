My First GitHub Repository

This is my first experience using gitHub. It's been a good experience thus far and I'm learning a lot. I enjoy music production, especially making music in the Digital Audio Workstation Logic Pro X. 

I am a self-taught music producer. I am soon to be a self-taught programmer!

I'm looking forward to joining in with the community!
